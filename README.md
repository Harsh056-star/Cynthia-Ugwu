# 🖥️ Cynthia Ugwu Portfolio Clone

A frontend clone of Cynthia Ugwu’s award-winning portfolio site, built for practice and educational purposes. The original site was honored by [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com) in 2023 for its creative use of motion, interactivity, and minimal design. This clone replicates that style using modern frontend technologies and advanced animations.
